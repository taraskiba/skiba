  abstract = {Despite the popularity of random forests (RF) as a prediction algorithm, methods for constructing confidence intervals for population means using this technique are still only sparsely reported. For two regional study areas (Spain and Norway) RF was used to predict forest volume or aboveground biomass using remotely sensed auxiliary data obtained from multiple sensors. Additionally, the changes per unit area of these forest attributes were estimated using indirect and direct methods. Multiple inferential frameworks have attracted increased recent attention for estimating the variances required for confidence intervals. For this study, three different statistical frameworks, design-based expansion, model-assisted and model-based estimators, were used for estimating population parameters and their variances. Pairs and wild bootstrapping approaches at different levels were compared for estimating the variances of the model-based estimates of the population means, as well as for mapping the uncertainty of the change predictions. The RF models accurately represented the relationship between the response and remotely sensed predictor variables, resulting in increased precision for estimates of the population means relative to design-based expansion estimates. Standard errors based on pairs bootstrapping within or internal to RF were considerably larger than standard errors based on both pairs and wild external bootstrapping of the entire RF algorithm. Pairs and wild external bootstrapping produced similar standard errors, but wild bootstrapping better mimicked the original structure of the sample data and better preserved the ranges of the predictor variables.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing has developed into an omnipresent technology in the scientific field of forestry and is also increasingly used in an operational fashion. However, the pace and level of uptake of remote sensing technologies into operational forest inventory and monitoring programs varies notably by geographic region. Herein, we highlight some key challenges that remote sensing research can address in the near future to further increase the acceptance, suitability and integration of remotely sensed data into operational forest inventory and monitoring programs. We particularly emphasize three recurrent themes: (1) user uptake, (2) technical challenges of remote sensing related to forest inventories and (3) challenges related to map validation. Our key recommendations concerning these three thematic areas include (1) a need to communicate and learn from success stories in those geographic regions where user uptake was successful due to multi-disciplinary collaborations supported by administrative incentives, (2) a shift from regional case studies towards studies addressing `real world' problems focusing on forest attributes that match the spatial scales and thematic information needs of end users and (3) an increased effort to develop, communicate, and apply best-practices for map and model validation including an effort to inform current and future remote sensing scientists regarding the need for and the functionalities of these best practices. Finally, we present information regarding the use of remote sensing for forest inventory and monitoring, combined with recommendations where possible, and highlighting areas of opportunity for additional investigation.},

  abstract = {Extensive vegetation inventories established with a probabilistic design are an indispensable tool in describing distributions of species and community types and detecting changes in composition in response to climate or other drivers. The Forest Inventory and Analysis Program measures vegetation in permanent plots on forested lands across the United States of America (GIVD ID NAUS-001). Plot sizes and protocols for measuring tree species are standardized across the country. Additional standardized protocols have been implemented to measure the abundance of non-tree vascular plant and epiphytic lichen species. Research using this and related regional datasets have provided new insights into the key biophysical drivers of community composition and their importance at different spatial scales. Studies have also explored regional differences in species diversity patterns, documented the importance of non-native species, and described the importance of environment and management on the distribution of selected species. Although representation of locally rare community types may be low, the probabilistic sample ensures that ecological drivers are regionally significant and that results are representative of a region as a whole. Remeasurement of permanent plots provides direct evidence of vegetation change and enables detection of impacts due to climate, natural disturbance, and forest management.},

  abstract = {LiDAR individual tree detection (ITD) is a promising tool for measuring forests at a scale that is meaningful ecologically and useful for forest managers. However, most ITD research evaluates methods over small homogeneous areas, while many forest managers work over large, complex landscapes. We investigated how ITD results varied across diverse structural conditions in California's Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forests and what this taught us about when and how to apply ITD. Our results suggest that it is advantageous to use ITD when it improves analysis interpretability, when measuring horizontal patterns, or when field data are unavailable. In the latter case, it is best to focus on measures dominated by large trees, like basal area and biomass. Thinking of ITD results as ``tree-approximate objects'' including one dominant tree and up to a few subordinate tree respects LiDAR's strengths and limitations; we illustrate how this concept keeps analyses consistent across varying structural conditions.},

  abstract = {The UNFCCC and interest in the source of the missing terrestrial carbon sink are prompting research and development into methods for carbon accounting in forest ecosystems. Here we present a canopy height quantile-based approach for quantifying above ground carbon content (AGCC) in a temperate deciduous woodland, by means of a discrete-return, small-footprint airborne LiDAR. Fieldwork was conducted in Monks Wood National Nature Reserve UK to estimate the AGCC of five stands from forest mensuration and allometric relations. In parallel, a digital canopy height model (DCHM) and a digital terrain model (DTM) were derived from elevation measurements obtained by means of an Optech Airborne Laser Terrain Mapper 1210. A quantile-based approach was adopted to select a representative statistic of height distributions per plot. A forestry yield model was selected as a basis to estimate stemwood volume per plot from these heights metrics. Agreement of r=0.74 at the plot level was achieved between ground-based AGCC estimates and those derived from the DCHM. Using a 20 20 m grids superposed to the DCHM, the AGCC was estimated at the stand level and at the woodland level. At the stand level, the agreement between the plot data upscaled in proportion to area and the LiDAR estimates was r=0.85. At the woodland level, LiDAR estimates were nearly 24\% lower than those from the upscaled plot data. This suggests that field-based approaches alone may not be adequate for carbon accounting in heterogeneous forests. Conversely, the LiDAR 20 20 m grid approach has an enhanced capability of monitoring the natural variability of AGCC across the woodland.},

  abstract = {Successful remote sensing methods and applications are rooted in the science, art, and technology of earth observation, part of the larger emerging world of geographical information science. Sensors are increasingly sensitive to the phenomena we wish to observe and image analysis systems are increasingly able to transform the data and deliver the required information. At the same time, advances in forest science and management continue to develop momentum. A renewed commitment to understanding forests at different scales and with a process-based perspective has helped generate demand for information about forests that is feasibly acquired only by remote sensing. Remote Sensing of Forest Environments: Concepts and Case Studies is an edited volume intended to provide readers with a state-of-the-art synopsis of the current methods and applied applications employed in remote sensing the world's forests. The contributing authors have sought to illustrate and deepen our understanding of remote sensing of forests, providing new insights and indicating opportunities that are created when forests and forest practices are considered in concert with the evolving paradigm of remote sensing science. Following background and methods sections, this book introduces a series of case studies that exemplify the ways in which remotely sensed data are operationally used, as an element of the decision-making process, and in the scientific study of forests. Remote Sensing of Forest Environments: Concepts and Case Studies is designed to meet the needs of a professional audience composed of both practitioners and researchers. This book is also suitable as a secondary text for graduate-level students in Forestry, Environmental Science, Geography, Engineering, and Computer Science.},
